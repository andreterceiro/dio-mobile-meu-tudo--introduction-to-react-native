# General

Besides the other characteristics do React Native, like generate the same app for Android and iOS with the same source code, one interesting characteristics of React Native is that its provide some already builded components to make more sense in a moble world (cellphone and tablets). You do not have to develop these components by scratch.

Teacher said that you can reuse 95% dof the code between the platforms (iOS and Android), not 100%.

Teacher also said that we have React Native for Windows and React Native for Mac to build software for these platforms.

Another thing commented by the teacher was React Native for Augmented Reality.

And teacher commented that some TVs are equipped with an Android Box, then you also can develop software with React Native for these platforms.

As you could saw in the teacher explanation, we will use the format TSX (TypeScript with XML), but some people use the format JSX (JavaScript with XML).
